# AHB2APB_Bridge_Model_HDL
This repository houses a hardware design project that implements an AHB (Advanced High-performance Bus) to APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) bridge in Verilog. The bridge facilitates seamless communication between these two common bus protocols, making it a valuable component for system-on-chip (SoC).
